# about
oci-viewer is a useful side project but is not among anyone's main responsibilities.

contributions, bug reports and feature requests are more than welcome, but please
be patient if it takes time to get to them.

# reporting issues

When reporting issues, please include screenshots and either a sample layout or 
set of layouts that exhibit the problem, or instructions on how to generate one.

# suggesting features

Please feel free to use github issues to also submit feature requests.

# general discussion

I've enabled github discussions on the repo for more open ended discussion or any q&a.

Thanks for your interest!
